## Summary

Programs primarily manipulate data, so a programming language needs good support not only for modelling processes, but also the data these processes manipulate.

For Origami, we're interested in modelling data structures that:

- Support evolution. That is, we must support defining and extending data structure definitions **without** breaking existing code. This rules out positional values and tagged unions (as commonly implemented).

- Support precise modelling. So we must support scalar types, aggregate types, and one-of types.

- Support serialisation and parsing.

- Support encapsulation with fine-grained capabilities. It should be possible to provide a read-only access to a single field in a data structure to someone without giving them access to the whole data structure. Same for write-only accesses.

This document describes how Origami achieves these goals.

## Records

In principle, Origami only has _record_ types. And they're anonymous and extensible. For example:

```
let point2d = { x: 1, y: 2 };
```

Constructs an anonymous record containing two labels, `x` and `y`, whose associated values are `1` and `2`. We could construct a new point based on this one:

```
let point3d = { point2d with z: 0 };
```

This constructs a point that has the same properties as the one referenced by `point2d`, plus the property `z`. The additional properties can also be used to override labels in the new record:

```
let point3d' = { point3d with z: 2 };
```

This constructs a new point that has `z = 2`, but the old `point3d` value is not changed. New records efficiently share the properties of the old ones, so the instantiation cost is proportional to the number of new/overriden properties, rather than all of the properties.

### Using records

We may use any value associated with a label by projecting it. For example:

```
let xyz = point3d.x + point3d.y + point3d.z;
```

We may access the values through pattern matching. For example:

```
let xyz = match point3d {
  case { x: a, y: b, z: c } -> a + b + c;
  // or as a short form:
  case { x, y, z } -> x + y + z;
}
```

Pattern matching also allows matching only parts of the record:

```
let xy = match point3d {
  case { x, y } -> x + y;
}
```

### Methods

Besides data, records also support object-oriented programming (through prototypes). These are defined with the `member` form. For example, a more complete point2d may be defined as:

```
let point2d_base = {
  member self.distance(aPoint) = match [self, aPoint] {
    case [{x1, y1}, { x2, y2 }] ->
      (((x2 - x1) ** 2) + ((y2 - y1) ** 2)).square_root();
  }
};

let p1 = { point2d_base with x: 1, y: 2 };
let p2 = { point2d_base with x: 3, y: 5 };

p1.distance(p2);
```

The familiar extension syntax (`{ base with new_props }`) works here to reuse methods defined in another record. This is a delegative form of inheritance, and no data is copied in memory--thus instantiations are both time and memory efficient.

### Type definitions

A record type may be defined that includes commonly used features. Type definitions fulfill the same role as classes in most object-oriented languages, and then some more. Unlike most class formulations, however, type definitions do not support inheritance.

Point2d could alternatively be defined as:

```
data Point2d {
  public x;
  public y;

  member self.distance(aPoint) = match [self, aPoint] {
    case [{ x1, y1 }, { x2, y2 }] ->
      (((x2 - x1) ** 2) + ((y2 - y1) ** 2)).square_root();
  }

}
```

Points are then constructed through a different form:

```
let p1 = Point2d { x: 1, y: 2 };
let p2 = Point2d { x: 3, y: 5 };
```

This both enforces that all fields that the type expect are provided, and inherits all of the methods from `Point2d`.

### Capabilities

The record form provides a way of constructing simple, extensible records, but does not give us anything to control who gets to access which pieces of data, and what they can do with it.

Capabilities have to be declared as record types in the module:

```
data Point2d { private x; private y }
```

This declares a record type with two fields. But these fields cannot be constructed by regular code. The following is not a valid point2d:

```
let p = { x: 1, y: 2 };
```

To construct a valid point2d, one must get a capability for constructing points. When declaring points in the module, the declaring name will contain all capabilities, so a point may be constructed as follows:

```
let point2d = Point2d { x: 1, y: 2 };
```

This uses the `constructing capability` in Point2d, and constructs a point with private fields. These fields cannot be projected in the regular way either, so the following fails, as there's no _publicly-accessible_ fields `x` or `y`:

```
point2d.x + point2d.y
// [TypeError] `x` is not a public field in point2d
```

So we also need a projection capability, which is again provided by the Point2d namespace:

```
Point2d.x(point2d) + Point2d.y(point2d);
```

Likewise, in order to pattern match, we must use the Point2d capability:

```
match point2d {
  case Point2d { x, y } -> x + y;
}
```

Finally, we can promote the record to a public one, with the Point2d capability:

```
let p = Point2d.promote(point2d);
p.x + p.y;
```

Or even lift a regular record into a Point2d one:

```
let p = Point2d.lift({ x: 1, y: 2 });
p.x;
// [TypeError] `x` is not a public field in p
```

### Granting fine-grained capabilities

Of course one may pass the entire `Point2d` capability around to allow other people to access and construct values of `Point2d`. But that's not always desirable. Sometimes you may be interested in only giving away the capability of _constructing_ values of `Point2d`, but not reading them. Or you may want to allow reading some fields, but not construct new values of the type or read other fields.

Record capabilities in Origami are just records with specific methods, as shown in the table below:

| **Capability**       | **Method**                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Constructing records | `member self { ... }`          |
| Projecting a field   | `member self.<field>(<value>)` |
| Pattern matching     | `member self.unapply(<value>)` |
| Promoting            | `member self.promote(<value>)` |
| Lifting              | `member self.lift(<value>)`    |
| Type testing         | `member value is self`         |

For example, to restrict the capabilities to only constructing `Point2d` and reading the `x` field we could use:

```
define RestrictedPoint2d = {
  member self { x, y } = Point2d { x, y };

  member self.x(value) = Point2d.x(value);

  member self.unapply(value) = match value {
    case Point2d { x } -> { x };
    default -> null;
  }
}
```

We can then pass `RestrictedPoint2d` around and be sure that people with a reference to it will never be able to access the field `y`, or promote point2d records to public ones. Something like this would always fail:

```
match point2d {
  case RestrictedPoint2d { x, y } -> "ok";
  default -> "failed";
}
--> "failed";
```
